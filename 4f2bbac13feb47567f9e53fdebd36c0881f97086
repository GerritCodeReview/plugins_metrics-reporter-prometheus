      "message": "Currently, there is just one label to contain a long string with the config. We could also add one label per option. If we then set the value of the metric to 1 instead of 0, it would be easy to create a plot that shows during which times the respective option was active and how some other metric behaved with or without this option.\nHowever, having a lot of labels, might impact the performance of Prometheus. This should be tested carefully. We could also create a metric per section and a label per option in that section.\nIn these cases you would have to take care of duplicate (list-type) options.",
