Configuration
=============

To access the monitoring URL, a user must be a member of a group that is granted
the ‘View Metrics’ capability (provided by this plugin) or the ‘Administrate
Server’ capability.This plugin requires no configuration.

This capability can be configured in the 'Global Capabilities' section of the
['All-Projects'](@URL@#/admin/projects/All-Projects,access) access right.

It is possible to allow anonymous access to the metrics by giving the capability
to the 'Anonymous Users' group.
