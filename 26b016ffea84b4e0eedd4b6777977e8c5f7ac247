      "message": "I checked other plugins and found that most (maybe all) of them have their package name\nin this format:\n\n  com.googlesource.gerrit.plugins.\u003cplugin-name\u003e\n\nSince this plugin is named metrics-reporter-prometheus, I just removed the dashes but otherwise\nfollowed the above pattern.\n\nI think that a more important discussion would be whether we want to merge the metrics reporter\nplugins into one plugin. Obviously (just look at my two series for the prometheus and jmx reporter) there is a potential for some code to be shared. I wouldn\u0027t go for the extraction\nof the common logic into an \"abstract\" plugin (like the its* family of plugins) because\nthis tends to be hard to maintain.",
